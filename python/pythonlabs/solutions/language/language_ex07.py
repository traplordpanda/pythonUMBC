""" A Solution For language_ex07

    Use a range to loop through and print each number from 0 to 49
    to produce the following output.
        â€¢ Each number should be printed individually as opposed
          to concatenating them as a string.

 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19
