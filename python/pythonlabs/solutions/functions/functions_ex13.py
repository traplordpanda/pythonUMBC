""" A Solution For functions_ex13
    While the index method of a list can be used to find either the first
    occurrence of an item or the first occurrence of it within a range of
    the list, it does not allow you to find, say the second or third
    occurrence by passing in a number as to the one you are looking for.
    • Write a function that takes 2 parameters; one being the list to search,
      and the other being an  int representing which one you are looking for
      such as the fist, second, third occurrence.
    • The index method raises a ValueError exception if the value being
      searched for does not exit in the list.
    • It is perfectly fine for your function to behave in the same manner.
